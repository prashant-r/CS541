Note : Respective README files in subfolders containing further information.

Overall Description: 

This project (and those to come) will be based on Minibase, a small relational DBMS, structured
into several layers. In this project, you are required to implement parts of the lower-level layers:
BM - the buffer manager layer and HFPage - the heap file layer. Layers should be tested and
turned in separately.
